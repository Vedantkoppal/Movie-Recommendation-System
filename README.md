Live Project: [Movie Recommendation System](https://recommend-me.onrender.com)

## üåü Description

'This is a movie recommender system , which recommends movies based on user's favourite movies. It is based on two datasets available on kaggle. The system live site uses Collaborative Filtering technique and Content based Filtering is also implemented in given jupyter notebooks notebooks. Two diffrent types of datasets are used and combined. I have created vectors from user-movie interaction and populated into Qdrant Vector Database. The core building of similarity model can be seen in Jupyter Notebooks provided in the repository. OMDB Movie API is used to fetch and store meta-data of movies.'
